### Security Issues

Found a security vulnerability? **Do not open a public issue.** Email benjamin@rankenstein.pro directly. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details.

## Common Issues

**Skills not appearing after installation:**
Restart Claude Code. Skills register on startup, not dynamically.

**DataForSEO returning errors:**
Check your MCP configuration in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Verify your credentials are correct and your account has credits.

**Banner generation failing:**
Ensure `KIE_API_KEY` is set in `~/.claude/skills/github/.env`. Check your KIE.ai account balance at https://kie.ai.

**Audit scores seem inconsistent:**
Run the audit again. Scores should be within 2-3 points across runs. If variance is larger, open a bug report with both outputs.
