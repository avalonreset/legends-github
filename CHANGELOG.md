All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Gemini CLI extension manifest and `GEMINI.md` context file so the skill suite can install through `gemini extensions install`.
- Legends GitHub social preview image.

### Changed

- Renamed public project branding from provider-specific GitHub variants to Legends GitHub.
- Updated README, citation metadata, support links, installer splash text, and generated artwork for the Legends GitHub name.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Codex compatibility layer with `install-codex.sh` and `install-codex.ps1`.
- Deterministic headless runtime under `github/scripts/run_headless.py` for audit, SEO, legal, community, metadata, README, release, and empire workflows.
- Python runtime requirements under `github/requirements.txt`.
- Dual-runtime audit orchestration guidance: Claude Code subagents and Codex multi-agents use the same 6 scoring roles.

### Changed

- Claude installers now also copy the headless runtime into `~/.claude/skills/github/scripts/`.
- Image generation standard moved to GPT Image 2 via KIE.ai.
- Skill docs now use Codex-native command names where appropriate while preserving Claude slash-command compatibility.
- Simplified provider-specific marketing copy so the public package presented as a Claude Code product while keeping Codex compatibility documented separately.
- Replaced the square mascot with a GPT Image 2 full-wolf variation.
- Expanded the install experience image to the full README content width.
- Replaced the terminal-style install screenshot with branded low-poly wolf system artwork.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) across all skills: audit generates a numbered remediation plan, each skill hands off to the next logical step, re-audit closes the loop
- Two-phase workflow: Phase 1 (per-repo optimization) and Phase 2 (portfolio optimization via /github empire)
- Canonical skill order: legal -> community -> release -> seo -> meta -> readme
- Clickable image link rules: all generated images output both local file:// and raw GitHub URLs for immediate terminal access
- Social preview generation guidance with download + upload links in github-meta skill
- .github/CODEOWNERS for automated PR review assignment

### Changed

- License changed from proprietary to MIT for open source release
- Repository published publicly under the original provider-specific repo name
- All internal URLs and badge references updated to public repository
- CONTRIBUTING.md rewritten with open source contribution guidelines
- CITATION.cff updated with MIT license and public repository URLs
- GitHub Discussions enabled for community Q&A
- Avatar pipeline simplified to JPEG-only (GitHub rejects WebP, PNGs often exceed 1MB)
- Lossless PNG originals preserved in assets/originals/ for user reference
- Contact email updated to benjamin@rankenstein.pro
- All em dashes removed from skill suite (replaced with regular hyphens)

### Removed
